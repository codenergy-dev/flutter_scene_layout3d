# flutter_scene_layout3d

Flutter's box layout protocol, in three dimensions, for
[flutter_scene](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_scene).

Constraints go down, sizes come up, and the parent decides where the child
sits. The rules are the ones you already know; what changes is that a box has
three extents, a position is a point in space, and the output of layout is a
tree of scene `Node` transforms rather than a display list.

> **Status: experimental.** The API may change between releases.

```dart
final surface = Layout3dSurface(
  constraints: Constraints3d.tight(const Size3d(4, 3, 0.5)),
  child: Column3d(
    mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment3d.center,
    spacing: 0.2,
    children: [
      NodeBox3d(content: Node(mesh: Mesh(cubeGeometry, material))),
      NodeBox3d(content: await loadScene('assets/lamp.glb')),
    ],
  ),
);

scene.root.add(surface.plane);
surface.flush();
```

Everything laid out hangs below `surface.plane`, so moving, turning, or
scaling that one node carries the whole arrangement with it:

```dart
surface.plane.rotation = Quaternion.axisAngle(Vector3(0, 1, 0), 0.4);
```

## The coordinate model

Layouts do their arithmetic in **layout space**: `x` right, `y` **down**, `z`
**away from the viewer**, with a box occupying `[0, width] x [0, height] x
[0, depth]` from its origin corner. That is Flutter's coordinate system with a
third axis added, which is why `Column3d`, `Align3d`, and `Stack3d` behave
exactly like their Flutter counterparts.

The scene does not see those coordinates. A `LayoutBasis3d` on the surface
maps them into the plane node's space, once, at the root:

```
LayoutBasis3d.xy (default)          LayoutBasis3d.xz
an upright panel facing you         a plane on the ground, seen from above

       scene +Y                          +---------+--> +X
          ^                              | [A][B]  |
   +------|------+                       | [C][D]  |
   |  [A]        |  Column3d runs         +---------+
   |  [B]        |  down the plane         v  layout y  ->  scene +Z
   |  [C]        |
   +-------------+--> scene +X            layout z -> scene -Y
```

`LayoutBasis3d.fromMatrix` takes any invertible matrix if the plane should sit
at some other angle. `Layout3dSurface.origin` says which point of the
laid-out box sits at the plane node's origin, and defaults to the centre.

## Sizing real 3D content

The hard part of a 3D layout is getting arbitrary content, primitives,
imported models, whole subtrees, to answer "how big are you?". `NodeBox3d`
answers it from the engine's own measurement, `Node.combinedLocalBounds`,
mapped out of scene space by the surface basis:

```dart
NodeBox3d(
  content: model,               // any Node, app-owned
  fit: BoxFit3d.contain,        // none, contain, fill, scaleDown
  alignment: Alignment3d.center,
)
```

* Content that cannot report bounds (skinned meshes, caller-managed geometry)
  measures as `fallbackSize`.
* `explicitSize` states a size outright and skips measuring.
* Override `readContentBounds` to measure content some other way.
* The box owns the content node's `localTransform`, centring the measured
  bounds in the box and undoing the surface basis so the model keeps the
  orientation it was authored with. Content that needs an offset of its own
  belongs inside a wrapper `Node`.

## What is in the box

| Layout | Flutter counterpart |
| --- | --- |
| `Layout3dSurface` | the root, plus `RenderView`'s job of starting layout |
| `Layout3d`, `SingleChildLayout3d`, `MultiChildLayout3d`, `ProxyLayout3d` | `RenderBox` and friends |
| `Constraints3d`, `Size3d`, `Offset3d`, `Alignment3d`, `EdgeInsets3d` | `BoxConstraints`, `Size`, `Offset`, `Alignment`, `EdgeInsets` |
| `Container3d`, `Padding3d`, `Align3d`, `Center3d` | `Container`, `Padding`, `Align`, `Center` |
| `SizedBox3d`, `ConstrainedBox3d`, `Transform3d` | `SizedBox`, `ConstrainedBox`, `Transform` |
| `Row3d`, `Column3d`, `Depth3d`, `Flexible3d`, `Expanded3d`, `Spacer3d` | `Row`, `Column`, `Flexible`, `Expanded`, `Spacer` |
| `Stack3d`, `Positioned3d` | `Stack`, `Positioned` |
| `Viewport3d`, `ListView3d`, `Scroll3dController` | `SingleChildScrollView`, `ListView`, `ScrollController` |
| `NodeBox3d` | the leaf that holds content |

`Depth3d` is the axis Flutter does not have: a flex that stacks children away
from the viewer.

## The declarative layer

`package:flutter_scene_layout3d/widgets.dart` describes the same tree from a
`build` method. Each widget owns one layout object and applies property
changes to it on rebuild, so an unchanged rebuild writes nothing; the element
tree does the reconciling.

```dart
import 'package:flutter_scene/scene.dart';
import 'package:flutter_scene_layout3d/widgets.dart';

SceneView.declarative(
  children: [
    SceneLayout3d(
      size: const Size3d(4, 3, 0.5),
      position: Vector3(0, 1, 0),
      child: SceneColumn3d(
        mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment3d.center,
        spacing: 0.2,
        children: [
          SceneNodeBox3d(content: cube),
          SceneExpanded3d(child: SceneNodeBox3d(content: banner)),
        ],
      ),
    ),
  ],
)
```

Every layout has a widget with the same name under a `Scene` prefix
(`SceneRow3d`, `SceneStack3d`, `ScenePositioned3d`, `SceneListView3d`, ...).
Attach a `Layout3dController` to reach the surface imperatively, for measured
sizes, scroll positions, or the plane node.

## Scrolling

`ListView3d` shows the window of its content at a `Scroll3dController`
offset. Built from an explicit list of children, every child is laid out and
the ones outside the window have their nodes hidden. `ListView3d.builder`
builds items on demand: with `itemExtent` nothing off-screen is ever built,
and without it items are measured once as they are first scrolled past, with
the total extent estimated from the average, the same approximation
`SliverList` makes.

There is no scroll physics here. In a 3D scene the gesture that drives
scrolling is the application's to choose (a drag on the `SceneView`, a
raycast, a thumbstick), so drive `Scroll3dController.offset` from whatever
input you have.

## How it differs from Flutter

* **Two cross axes.** A flex has one main axis and two cross axes, so
  `crossAxisAlignment` is joined by `depthAxisAlignment`. They follow
  canonical `x`, `y`, `z` order with the main axis removed.
* **`Flexible3d` and `Positioned3d` are layouts, not parent-data widgets.**
  They sit in the tree as real boxes, and the enclosing flex or stack reads
  their properties off them.
* **`Stack3d.depthStep`** pulls each successive child toward the viewer, which
  is how "later children paint on top" is spelled when the children are real
  geometry that would otherwise be coplanar.
* **List items are not stretched by default.** `ListView3d` centres its items
  across the cross axes; ask for `CrossAxisAlignment3d.stretch` for the
  Flutter behaviour.
* **No intrinsic sizing yet**, so no `IntrinsicWidth`/`IntrinsicHeight`
  equivalents and no baseline alignment.
* **No painting.** These layouts arrange content; they never draw. A visible
  panel is a mesh in a `NodeBox3d`.

## Roadmap

Slivers (`SliverList3d`, `SliverGrid3d`, and a real `Viewport3d` protocol),
`GridView3d`, `Wrap3d`, intrinsic sizing, lazy building in the declarative
layer, and input-driven scrolling.
